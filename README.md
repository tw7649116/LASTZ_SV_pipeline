## Description

This pipeline is designed to specifically identify structral variations (e.g. Insertions, Deletions, Copy Number Variations (especially for tandem duplications),Inversions, and other unfined complex patterns of SVs) using high-quality chromosome-level assemblies between/among related species or within species, prilimnarily based on Lastz/Chain/Net tools. Further effort will also aim to resolve inter-genomic translocations and other complex SVs.
